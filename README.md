# Delhi AQI Analysis and Forecasting
This project analyzes Air Quality Index (AQI) data for Delhi, focusing on key pollutants and their trends. The code also builds and evaluates a time series forecasting model for PM2.5 concentrations using Facebook's Prophet library.

**Project Overview**
The main objectives of this project are:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
# 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize pollutant trends across various time dimensions.
Feature Engineering: Extract temporal features to enrich the dataset.
Trend Analysis: Study pollutant levels across seasons, months, and hours.
Correlation Analysis: Explore relationships between different pollutants.
Time Series Forecasting: Forecast PM2.5 levels using the Prophet library.
Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.7+
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Prophet
You can install the dependencies using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn prophet
Features
1. Data Preprocessing
Reads the AQI data (delhi_aqi.csv) and converts the date column to datetime.
Sets the date column as the index for time series operations.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizes pollutant trends (e.g., CO, PM2.5) using line plots and box plots.
Examines PM2.5 concentration trends across weekdays, months, and seasons.
3. Feature Engineering
Extracts temporal features such as hour, dayofweek, month, year, season, etc., for detailed analysis.
Categorizes months into meteorological seasons for better seasonal insights.
4. Trend Analysis
Line plots for PM2.5 concentrations over months and seasons.
Bar plots showing average PM2.5 levels across seasons and months.
5. Correlation Analysis
Heatmap to explore correlations between key pollutants (e.g., CO, NO, NO2, PM2.5).
6. Time Series Forecasting
Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Fits a Prophet model to forecast PM2.5 levels.
Visualizes actual vs. forecasted values for December 2022.
Instructions
Load the Data: Ensure delhi_aqi.csv is in the same directory as the script. The file should contain AQI readings with a date column.

Run the Code: Execute the script to visualize pollutant trends and generate forecasts for PM2.5 concentrations.

Analyze Results:

Examine descriptive statistics for pollutant concentrations.
Study seasonal and hourly patterns in PM2.5 levels.
Evaluate the performance of the Prophet model by comparing actual and forecasted values.
Key Outputs
Visualizations:
Line plots for pollutant trends (e.g., PM2.5 over months and seasons).
Box plots for PM2.5 concentrations by day of the week and season.
Heatmap showing correlations between pollutants.
Forecasts:
PM2.5 forecasts for the test period (December 2022).
Prophet model components such as trends and seasonal effects.
Example Visualizations
PM2.5 Trends: Seasonal and monthly variations in air quality.
Forecast Accuracy: Actual vs. predicted PM2.5 levels for December 2022.
Future Enhancements
Incorporate additional meteorological data (e.g., temperature, humidity) to improve forecast accuracy.
Experiment with advanced machine learning models for time series analysis.
